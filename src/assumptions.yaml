# Assumptions (variables and values) for the digital CO2 footprint calculator
# These values can be overridden by user input in the app, but these are the defaults.
# If you add a new variable here, you also need to:
# add a description (and source, if any) in translations.py
# add it to the list of editable variables in the sidebar in app.py 
# use it in the calculations in calculator.py
